- Kitajima 1994, Ausperger, Coley 1988, 1983,
- Dalling & Hubbell - relative growth rate of seedlings in gaps correlated with mortality rate

- Poorter - leaf traits are good predictors

- Thomas 2010: LMA increases with size


# Biomass allometry

- Whittaker 1974, Fig1 plots fraction of mass being different tissues

# 2012.08.31  See King 2006 models height growth rate

- uses growth data reconstructed from tree ring data for a douglas fir.
- David commented that " Robert (Bob) Monserud relayed the message to me via the editors that he has old stem analysis data that could also address this issue.  I never followed up on this, but it might be worth contacting him if you're interested in repeated measures of tree boles over time, as determined by stem analysis."

Thomas 1999 - LMA of adults greater than saplings, larger change for taller trees.

Lusk Fecol 2008 - estimates minimum light requirement for species, shows that this increases with size, and correlates with LMA

Augsperger 1984 - In both sun and shade, growth rate and height (of seedlings) at 1 year are not correlated with adult wood density or shade tolerance.

Dalling & Hubbell 2002 - In the 18 months following the first dry season we observed an uncoupling of seed mass from seedling performance. Seedling mortality was now a function of maximum relative growth rate, with higher mortality of fast-growing species attributable to herbivory, notably by shoot-borers.

Rueger et al (in prep) - LMA has no influence on growth rates of larger plants, whereas

Herault et al 2011 - hump shaped curve, influence of WD and Hmax on curve, no influence of LMA or seed mass on growth of larger plants

Scaling of respiration with mass - moving from slope of 1.0 to 0.75 (see Mori et al 2010, also Reich in prep)

[Sillet 2010](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2009.12.003), Supplementary Appendix F. Shows a plot of height growth rate vs size for S. sempervirens forest, showing hump shaped curve, derived from a combination of direct measurement, dendrochronology and stem cores.  Height growth rate peaks at 80cm/yr at around 30m of height, and after that declines.
