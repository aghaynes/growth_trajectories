  abstract = {1. Demography and allometry of the dioecious tree Cecropia obtusifolia were studied in a 5-ha permanent plot at Los Tuxtlas rain forest, Mexico. Treefall gaps were aged and a significant positive correlation was found between gap age and tree size. Active regeneration of the species was suggested by the high proportion ({\textgreater}35\%) of young individuals. The population was highly clumped among young juvenile trees and became less aggregated as density within-gaps decreased among older trees. New and successful recruitment was restricted to recently formed ({\textless}3 years since opened) and large ({\textgreater} 100-m{\textasciicircum}2) gaps. Oldest individuals (35 m high) were growing in 37-year-old gaps. 2. Tree height and stem diameter increased allometrically with a slope {\textless}1.5 in trees {\textgreater}0.3 m tall. The margin between the actual tree diameter (d) and the theoretical minimum buckling diameter (dmin.) declined exponentially from c. 20 in juvenile trees to almost 1 in the oldest trees ({\textgreater}30 years old). Whilst the number of leaves remains fairly constant before branching, it increases linearly as the number of branches increase. Changes in area per leaf during the life cycle yield an overall allometric pattern between tree height and total leaf area. 3. Seed and seedling mortality was {\textgreater} 99\%. Reduced light, falling debris, movement of rotting logs and soil dryness were important mortality factors in pre-reproductive stages. Oldest adults died standing, apparently due to senescence. Maximum life expectancy is reached when trees attain a non-suppressed canopy position (c. 20 m high). Individuals showed high growth rates (a stem-diameter increment of up to 2 cm year -1). Growth-rate variation in juvenile stages seem to be related to high environmental heterogeneity. In adult stages the number of conspecifics growing in the same gap seems to affect diameter growth rate negatively. First reproduction occurred at about 3 years of age (when 10 cm in diameter) and increased with age. Annual fecundity rates of individuals ranged from 1.4 × 104 to 1.4 × 107 seeds and increased allometrically with stem diameter and number of branches. 4. The most important environmental filter in the life-cycle of C. obtusifolia operates from the seedling to the juvenile stage. This finding does not support the suggestion that pioneer limitation to gap regeneration is determined during germination. The allometric and demographic traits of C. obtusifolia correspond to those expected for a shade-intolerant species that colonizes ephemeral sites, and they contrast with those of purported shade-tolerant tree species reported in the literature. However, rather than finding two clearly distinguishable types of life-histories, a continuum of demographic life-cycles was found. Therefore, the dichotomous pioneer-climax framework should be viewed as a means of identifying the extremes of a continuum of tree life histories.},

  abstract = {Abstract 1. Shade tolerance, defined as the ability to survive and grow under low light, varies markedly among tree species. However, the role of low-light growth responses in determining shade tolerance is unclear, as are the effects of non-light resources such as soil nutrients. 2. A conceptually simple field measure of shade tolerance is the whole-plant light compensation point ({WPLCP)}, evaluated as the x-intercept of the relationship between growth and incident light integrated over a long time interval. Here we compare {WPLCP} for growth and survivorship of saplings of Bornean tree species differing in shade tolerance, and evaluate the importance of various physiological and morphological traits in predicting {WPLCP.} We also examine both phenotypic and evolved differences in {WPLCP} between tree saplings growing on two distinct soil types at Sepilok Forest Reserve, Sabah, Malaysia. 3. Growth-based estimates of {WPLCP} showed essentially a 1 : 1 correspondence to threshold light levels for survivorship. At higher light, more light-demanding species showed higher growth, resulting in a steeper slope of the relationship between relative growth rate ({RGR)} and light availability than in more shade-tolerant species. This resulted in significant crossovers in the {RGR-light} relationship among species. 4. Dark respiration (Rd) was the single best predictor of {WPLCP;} other leaf traits such as leaf nitrogen and photosynthetic capacity were correlated with, but excluded as predictors of, {WPLCP} in multiple regression analyses. 5. Although soil type had no consistent phenotypic effect on {WPLCP}, evolved responses among species were pronounced: species associated with the nutrient-poor, drought-prone, sandstone-derived soils had higher {WPLCP} values than alluvial soil specialists in phylogenetically controlled comparisons. 6. Our results indicate that minimum light levels for growth do not diverge from those for survivorship, and do not support the view that low-light survivorship solely determines shade tolerance. Our analyses also suggest that Rd is the strongest determinant of whole-plant light requirements in tropical tree saplings, and thus may be an easily measured surrogate of {WPLCP} and shade tolerance. 7. Prediction of tree species resource requirements is crucial for understanding forest dynamics and promoting ecology-based forest management and restoration, particularly in diverse tropical forests where data on the resource requirements of most species are not available. Easily measured surrogates of resource requirements (e.g. Rd as a predictor of shade tolerance) will contribute to this goal, as will an improved understanding of the interactive effects of multiple resources on tree performance.

  abstract = {Abstract  A range of traits, including metabolic costs, biomass allocation and seed reserves, may contribute to interspecific variation in the shade tolerance of tree seedlings. In addition, shade tolerance may be affected by differential responses of species to soil resource availability at low light. We used a custom-built whole-plant gas-exchange chamber to quantify instantaneous whole-plant light compensation point ({WPLCP)} and to parameterize whole-plant daily C gain models for seedlings of eight temperate deciduous tree species. We examined the relationship of {WPLCP} to growth, biomass allocation and gas-exchange under high and low light and nutrient availabilities and compared it to {WPCLP} of naturally recruited saplings. For species showing a response, both increased light and nutrient availability resulted in increased {WPLCP.} However, species’ responses to resource availability did not correspond closely with shade tolerance as has generally been predicted. Variation in {WPLCP} within species was best predicted by whole-plant dark respiration rates, leaf-level light compensation point and leaf mass per area. Among species, seed size was a strong negative correlate of {WPLCP}, explaining 66\% of the variation. Species with the lowest {WPLCP} maintained lower growth rates across treatments but greater biomass in the low-light treatment compared with more light-demanding species. These data suggest that a number of traits, in particular metabolic costs and seed size, contribute to {WPLCP.} However, gas-exchange-based {WPLCP} was 1.5–3.5 times lower than corresponding growth-based field estimates of {WPLCP}, suggesting that other factors such as biotic interactions or ontogenetic shifts in whole-plant light requirements may substantially increase species’ {WPLCP} under natural conditions.},

  abstract = {Wood performs several essential functions in plants, including mechanically supporting aboveground tissue, storing water and other resources, and transporting sap. Woody tissues are likely to face physiological, structural and defensive trade-offs. How a plant optimizes among these competing functions can have major ecological implications, which have been under-appreciated by ecologists compared to the focus they have given to leaf function. To draw together our current understanding of wood function, we identify and collate data on the major wood functional traits, including the largest wood density database to date (8412 taxa), mechanical strength measures and anatomical features, as well as clade-specific features such as secondary chemistry. We then show how wood traits are related to one another, highlighting functional trade-offs, and to ecological and demographic plant features (growth form, growth rate, latitude, ecological setting). We suggest that, similar to the manifold that tree species leaf traits cluster around the {"}leaf economics spectrum{"}, a similar wood economics spectrum may be defined. We then discuss the biogeography, evolution and biogeochemistry of the spectrum, and conclude by pointing out the major gaps in our current knowledge of wood functional traits.},

  abstract = {1 Innate mean relative growth rate (mean {RGR)} of seedlings is a key attribute for the performance of species in their natural habitats. This study aimed firstly at identifying easily measurable correlates of mean {RGR} of temperate zone woody species. Secondly, it tested the hypothesis that functional groups of woody plants could be characterized by their mean {RGR} and associated allocation and leaf attributes. 2 In a standardized experiment, 80 woody species from the British Isles and North Spain, ranging widely in leaf habit and life- form, were screened for seed weight and potential seedling mean relative growth rate ({RGR)}, biomass allocation and leaf attributes. 3 Mean {RGR}, when based on plant weights excluding any attached thick cotyledons, was linearly and closely correlated with leaf area ratio ({LAR}, total leaf area/plant dry weight) and one of the two components of {LAR}, specific leaf area ({SLA}, leaf area/leaf dry weight). The other component, leaf weight fraction (leaf weight/plant dry weight), was only correlated with mean {RGR} when based upon true leaves, disregarding leafy cotyledons. These relationships were also demonstrated when taxonomic relatedness was accounted for. 4 The data supported the hypothesis that differentiation, as seen among functional groups of species in terms of leaf habit and life-form, corresponded with differentiation in mean {RGR} and other seedling attributes. For instance, deciduous species grew consistently faster than evergreens. 5 When {SLA} was split into its two components, specific saturated leaf area ({SSLA}, total leaf area/total saturated leaf weight) and leaf saturated weight/dry weight ratio ({SW/DW)}, it was found that {SSLA} was consistently smaller in evergreens than in deciduous species, both for sclerophyllous and succulent leaves. Among species of the same leaf habit, variation in {SLA} among life-forms could be explained by variation in leaf {SW/DW.} 6 {SSLA} and leaf {SW/DW} both easy to measure, together could help to categorize growth rate within the evergreen or deciduous species. This may be useful in vegetation monitoring. 7 The data may provide useful predictive tools to infer potential growth rates and nutrient conservation strategies of real vegetation from the functional attributes and composition of its functional species groups.},

  abstract = {1. Plant traits vary widely across species and underpin differences in ecological strategy. Despite centuries of interest, the contributions of different evolutionary lineages to modern-day functional diversity remain poorly quantified.
Expanding data bases of plant traits plus rapidly improving phylogenies enable for the first time a data-driven global picture of plant functional diversity across the major clades of higher plants. We mapped five key traits relevant to metabolism, resource competition and reproductive strategy onto a phylogeny across 48324 vascular plant species world-wide, along with climate and biogeographic data. Using a novel metric, we test whether major plant lineages are functionally distinctive. We then highlight the trait–lineage combinations that are most functionally distinctive within the present-day spread of ecological strategies.
For some trait–clade combinations, knowing the clade of a species conveys little information to neo- and palaeo-ecologists. In other trait–clade combinations, the clade identity can be highly revealing, especially informative clade–trait combinations include Proteaceae, which is highly distinctive, representing the global slow extreme of the leaf economic spectrum. Magnoliidae and Rosidae contribute large leaf sizes and seed masses and have distinctively warm, wet climatic distributions.
Synthesis. This analysis provides a shortlist of the most distinctive trait–lineage combinations along with their geographic and climatic context: a global view of extant functional diversity across the tips of the vascular plant phylogeny.},

  abstract = {Linking functional traits to plant growth is critical for scaling attributes of organisms to the dynamics of ecosystems1, 2 and for understanding how selection shapes integrated botanical phenotypes3. However, a general mechanistic theory showing how traits specifically influence carbon and biomass flux within and across plants is needed. Building on foundational work on relative growth rate4, 5, 6, recent work on functional trait spectra7, 8, 9, and metabolic scaling theory10, 11, here we derive a generalized trait-based model of plant growth. In agreement with a wide variety of empirical data, our model uniquely predicts how key functional traits interact to regulate variation in relative growth rate, the allometric growth normalizations for both angiosperms and gymnosperms, and the quantitative form of several functional trait spectra relationships. The model also provides a general quantitative framework to incorporate additional leaf-level trait scaling relationships7, 8 and hence to unite functional trait spectra with theories of relative growth rate, and metabolic scaling. We apply the model to calculate carbon use efficiency. This often ignored trait, which may influence variation in relative growth rate, appears to vary directionally across geographic gradients. Together, our results show how both quantitative plant traits and the geometry of vascular transport networks can be merged into a common scaling theory. Our model provides a framework for predicting not only how traits covary within an integrated allometric phenotype but also how trait variation mechanistically influences plant growth and carbon flux within and across diverse ecosystems.},

  abstract = {1.	Numerous plant traits are known to influence aspects of individual performance, including rates of carbon uptake, tissue turnover, mortality and fecundity. These traits are bound to influence emergent properties of vegetation because quantities such as leaf-area cover, average height, primary productivity and density of standing biomass result from the collective behaviour of individuals. Yet, little is known about the influence of individual traits on these emergent properties, despite the widespread use in current vegetation models of plant functional types, each of which is defined by a constellation of traits. 2.	We examine the influence of four key traits (leaf economic strategy, height at maturation, wood density, and seed size) on four emergent vegetation properties (average height of leaf area, leaf-area index, net primary productivity and biomass density). We employ a trait-, size- and patch-structured model ({TSPM)} of vegetation dynamics that allows scaling up from individual-level growth processes and probabilistic disturbances to landscape-level predictions. A physiological growth model incorporating relevant trade-offs was designed and calibrated based on known empirical patterns. The resulting vegetation model naturally exhibits a range of phenomena commonly observed in vegetation dynamics. 3.	We modelled single-species stands, varying each trait over its known empirical range. Seed size had only a small effect on vegetation properties, primarily because our metapopulations were not seed-limited. The remaining traits all had larger effects on vegetation properties, especially on biomass density. Leaf economic strategy influenced minimum light requirement, and thus total leaf area and basal area. Wood density and height at maturation influenced vegetation mainly by modifying individual stem mass. These effects of traits were maintained, and sometimes amplified, across stands differing in productivity and mean disturbance interval. 4.	Synthesis: Natural trait variation can cause large differences in emergent properties of vegetation, the magnitudes of which approach those arising through changes to site productivity and disturbance frequency. Our results therefore underscore the need for next-generation vegetation models that incorporate functional traits together with their effects on the patch and size structure of vegetation.},

  volume = {100},
  abstract = {Stem xylem characteristics have a great impact on growth and adult stature of trees because of their role in mechanical support, long-distance water transport and whole-plant carbon allocation. Yet, despite the potential causal link between xylem traits and plant growth/adult stature, most studies have tried to link wood density, an indirect but easy to measure proxy for wood properties, to tree growth and size. To determine whether xylem traits outperform wood density as predictors of tree growth and stature, we evaluated the covariation among wood density, xylem anatomical traits, tree diameter growth rate and adult stature in 40 Asian tropical tree species through principal component analyses and through bivariate correlation, both across species and across phylogenetically independent contrasts. Vessel diameter exhibited a tight negative relationship with vessel frequency. Wood density showed a significant correlation with vessel diameter and density, but not with vessel fraction. Most correlations between functional traits indicate adaptive coordination, demonstrated by significant correlations between phylogenetically independent contrasts. Across species, diameter growth rate and adult stature were positively correlated with vessel lumen diameter and potential hydraulic conductivity, but not with wood density. Thus, our results suggest that xylem anatomical traits that are linked to hydraulic conductivity are better predictors of tree growth rate and adult stature than wood density. Synthesis. We found that xylem anatomical traits have a more significant influence on whole-plant performance due to their direct association with stem hydraulic conductivity, whereas wood density is decoupled from hydraulic function due to complex variations in xylem components. © 2011 The Authors.

  abstract = {Whole-plant energy capture depends not only on the photosynthetic response of individual leaves, but also on their integration into an effective canopy, and on the costs of producing and maintaining their photosynthetic capacity. This paper explores adaptation to irradiance level in this context, focusing on traits whose significance would be elusive if considered in terms of their impact at the leaf level alone. I review traditional approaches used to demonstrate or suggest adaptation to irradiance level, and outline three energetic tradeoffs likely to shape such adaptation, involving the economics of gas exchange, support, and biotic interactions. Recent models using these tradeoffs to account for trends in leaf nitrogen content, stornatal conductance, phyllotaxis, and defensive allocations in sun v. shade are evaluated. A re-evaluation of the classic study of acclimation of the photosynthetic light response in Atriplex, crucial to interpreting adaptation to irradiance in many traits, shows that it does not completely support the central dogma of adaptation to sun v. shade unless the results are analysed in terms of whole-plant energy capture. Calculations for Liriodendron show that the traditional light compensation point has little meaning for net carbon gain, and that the effective compensation point is profoundly influenced by the costs of night leaf respiration, leaf construction, and the construction of associated support and root tissue. The costs of support tissue are especially important, raising the effective compensation point by 140 µmol m-2 s-1 in trees 1 m tall, and by nearly 1350 µmol m-2 s-1 in trees 30 m tall. Effective compensation points give maximum tree heights as a function of irradiance, and shade tolerance as a function of tree height; calculations of maximum permissible height in Liriodendron correspond roughly with the height of the tallest known individual. Finally, new models for the evolution of canopy width/height ratio in response to irradiance and coverage within a tree stratum, and for the evolution of mottled leaves as a defensive measure in understory herbs, are outlined.},

D950.1 was determined for 573 species with at least 20 trees with diameters {\textgreater}=0.1 × maximum observed diameter in old-growth, lowland evergreen forest on the 50-ha forest dynamics plot at Pasoh Forest Reserve, Malaysia.

Among trees of similar diameter, growth rates increased across life forms from the smallest to largest. These differences in growth rate among life forms may be due to associated differences in allometry, photosynthetic capacity and reproductive allocation.},

  abstract = {Leaf spacing and aboveground growth were monitored in saplings of ten species in a range of light environments in a Panamanian lowland humid forest. One- to 2-m-tall individuals of the chosen species had intermediate to large leaves on stems with few or no branches. Saplings in high light environments grew faster in height and produced more biomass per unit leaf area than shaded saplings for all species. These growth responses involved morphological plasticity with greater extension per unit biomass increment increasing the height growth rate of gap-grown saplings and greater biomass allocation to leaves decreasing the whole plant light compensation point in shade. The relative performance of the species also varied across the light gradient and was related to differences in leaf lifespan and specific leaf mass. Light-demanding species grew as rapidly in shade as shade-tolerant species, but the shorter leaf lifespan of the former necessitates higher production rates to maintain a given leaf area, largely excluding light-demanders from shaded understory locations. Height growth rate was positively correlated with leaf spacing for each species, and differences between species in the height growth rate-internode length relationship were related to interspecific differences in specific leaf mass. Thus, sapling growth histories may be inferred from their morphologies.},

  abstract = {Juvenile foliage on seedlings and saplings occurs across a wide range of tree species and is particularly notable among eucalypts. Juvenile leaves generally have a lower leaf mass per area ({LMA)} and are often more horizontal in orientation than adult leaves. This paper examines the hypothesis that the shift from juvenile to adult foliage is related to the scaling of mechanical support costs. A simple model of stem allometry and production was used to show that low values of {LMA} and leaf area per unit crown area ({LAI)} should increase the growth rates of small, open-grown seedlings, but not larger saplings or trees. This result occurs because relatively little biomass need be invested in stems and branches to spread out the leaf mass of a seedling, favoring the option of increasing light interception by increasing crown area. In contrast, the large support requirements of trees make increasing crown area expensive and favor shifts to higher {LAI} and {LMA}, thereby increasing within-crown light interception and light use efficiency. Reported {LMA} values for juveniles are lower than for older trees under similar light levels, and there is evidence for similar trends in {LAI.} However, juvenile foliage may have a variety of other functions, including the enhancement of shade tolerance, and trade-offs may also occur between efficient light interception and protection against herbivores and mechanical damage. Model simulations suggest that the nature and duration of the juvenile phase can have large impacts on early growth, particularly in favorable environments.},

  abstract = {The influence of stem allometry on tree growth is explored with a simple model which projects growth for the idealized case where crown proportions, leaf properties and light use efficiency are held constant throughout growth. Here, the tree is regarded as a machine that grows itself by using light energy to synthesize biomass, which is in turn partitioned among its parts so as to maintain a specified allometry. The following model variants were considered. (1) The base case, which approximates a forest-grown tree, shows that the requirement that basal trunk diameter Db ∝ H1.5 (where H is total tree height), to prevent buckling, substantially slows the height growth rate with increasing tree size, as is observed in real trees. (2) The isometric tree, which maintains geometric similarity, such that Db ∝ H, has a nearly constant height growth rate, attaining 40 m in 1/3 of the time required for the more realistic, base case tree. (3) The “seedling tree”, which maintains constant leaf/stem mass (that of a seedling), requiring that Db ∝ H0.5, grows exponentially throughout life, attaining 40 m in 1/20 of the time required for the base case. (4) The “leech tree”, which reconfigures its branches, leaves and roots as it grows, rather than turning over these parts, shows that such replacement costs substantially slow growth and reduce shade tolerance. These results demonstrate the strong links between allometry and growth and suggest that differences in support costs are an important cause of observed interspecific differences in height growth rate.},

  abstract = {Summary 1 The rapid growth rates of light-demanding tree species have been attributed in part to their low-density, low-cost stems. We evaluated the influence of light and biomass support costs on growth rates of trees 8-25 cm in diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) among 21 species differing in wood density in two aseasonal rain forests. 2 Measurements of crown width, tree height, d.b.h. and wood density (rho) were used to estimate the stem biomass (Ms) of a standard-sized tree (17 m tall and 16 m2 in crown area), i.e. the cost in stem biomass of supporting a given sized crown at a given height. 3 The species showed a three-fold range in support cost, which was highly correlated with wood density (Ms rho0.77, r2 = 0.72 for the log-transformed relationship). This relationship is due to the high interspecific variation in wood density and the fact that the stem diameter of the standard-sized tree increased only slightly with decreasing wood density, i.e. light-wooded species did not compensate for their lighter, weaker wood by substantially increasing stem thickness. 4 Mean growth rate per species showed a 10-fold range and increased with the fraction of trees at least partly in gaps (gap fraction), the reciprocal of support cost ({1/Ms)}, and the reciprocal of wood density (1/rho). The relationship between mean growth rate and {1/Ms} was particularly strong when one outlier was excluded (r2 = 0.88) and among the Dipterocarpaceae (r2 = 0.89). 5 Log(mortality rate), as determined for all trees per species {\textgreater}= 1 cm d.b.h., increased linearly with {1/Ms}, 1/rho and gap fraction. 6 These results suggest an important role for wood density and support costs in the classic tradeoff between rapid growth and increased risks of damage and death.

This paper explores the hypothesis that mechanical support costs of growing trees contributes to tree height limitation and general growth decline in aging trees. The chapter reviews scaling hypotheses, including geometric similarity, elastic similarity, stress similarity, and the pipe model, as well as the patterns in tree allometry that have been reported. It then uses the remarkable published record of diameter, volume and height growth, deriving from stem analysis, of one 437-year-old, 83-m-tall noble fir ( Abies procera ) to evaluate the degree to which different scaling models apply at different stages in that tree’s life. The analysis suggests that the overall pattern of height growth could be related to tree allometry and wood production rates, but that the tree showed substantial decadal variation around the general patterns. The chapter suggests that many more studies are needed to characterize individual trees, either with known environments or after manipulations that alter allometry, and in different ecosystems beyond the Pacific Northwest and California. Such data will enable scientists to analyze the degree to which these allometric models pertain in different plant types and at different life stages, and will give insight into the role of mechanical and hydraulic support in the limitation of tree growth and productivity.},

For this purpose, tree height, crown width in two perpendicular directions, trunk diameter at 1.3 m height (d.b.h.) and crown illumination index ({CI)} were determined for 727 pole-sized trees (8-20 cm d.b.h.) of 21 species, on forest dynamics plots at Pasoh Forest Reserve, Peninsular Malaysia and Lambir Hills National Park, Sarawak, Malaysia. A light-interception index ({LI} = A({cr)CI(2)}, where A(cr) is crown area) was calculated for each tree, and wood density (stem wood dry mass/fresh volume) was estimated for each species from reported values. 2. Diameter growth rates were linearly correlated with {LI} (mean per species r(2) = 0.45, excluding substantially damaged and vine-covered trees). 3. Among trees of all species, diameter growth rate was highly correlated with {LI/wood} density. 4. Mean growth rate per species varied 10-fold among the study species, but increased linearly with mean {LI/wood} density ratio (r(2) = 0.78), consistent with the previous pattern. 5. Thus much of the variability in tree growth rates, both within and among species, can be accounted for by the simple mechanistic assumption that, within a given size class, growth is proportional to light interception/wood density.},

  doi = {10.1093/aob/mct036},
  abstract = {Background and Aims Leaf life span is widely recognized as a key life history trait associated with herbivory resistance, but rigorous comparative data are rare for seedlings. The goal of this study was to examine how light environment affects leaf life span, and how ontogenetic development during the first year may influence leaf fracture toughness, lamina density and stem density that are relevant for herbivory resistance, leaf life span and seedling survival.
Methods Data from three experiments encompassing 104 neotropical woody species were combined. Leaf life span, lamina and vein fracture toughness, leaf and stem tissue density and seedling survival were quantified for the first-year seedlings at standardized ontogenetic stages in shade houses and common gardens established in gaps and shaded understorey in a moist tropical forest in Panama. Mortality of naturally recruited seedlings till 1 year later was quantified in 800 1-m2 plots from 1994 to 2011.
Key Results Median leaf life span ranged widely among species, always greater in shade (ranging from 151 to {\textgreater}1790 d in the understorey and shade houses) than in gaps (115–867 d), but with strong correlation between gaps and shade. Leaf and stem tissue density increased with seedling age, whereas leaf fracture toughness showed only a weak increase. All these traits were positively correlated with leaf life span. Leaf life span and stem density were negatively correlated with seedling mortality in shade, while gap mortality showed no correlation with these traits.
Conclusions The wide spectrum of leaf life span and associated functional traits reflects variation in shade tolerance of first-year seedlings among coexisting trees, shrubs and lianas in this neotropical forest. High leaf tissue density is important in enhancing leaf toughness, a known physical defence, and leaf life span. Both seedling leaf life span and stem density should be considered as key functional traits that contribute to seedling survival in tropical forest understoreys.},

  abstract = {Traditional rankings of shade tolerance of trees make little reference to individual size. However, greater respiratory loads with increasing sapling size imply that larger individuals will be less able to tolerate shade than smaller individuals of the same species and that there may be shifts among species in shade tolerance with size. We tested this hypothesis using maximum likelihood estimation to develop individual-tree-based models of the probability of mortality as a function of recent growth rate for seven species: trembling aspen, paper birch, yellow birch, mountain maple, white spruce, balsam fir and eastern white cedar. Shade tolerance of small individuals, as quantified by risk of mortality at low growth, was mostly consistent with traditional shade tolerance rankings such that cedar > balsam fir > white spruce > yellow birch > mountain maple = paper birch > aspen. Differences in growth-dependent mortality were greatest between species in the smallest size classes. With increasing size, a reduced tolerance to shade was observed for all species except trembling aspen and thus species tended to converge in shade tolerance with size. At a given level of radial growth larger trees, apart from aspen, had a higher probability of mortality than smaller trees. Successional processes associated with shade tolerance may thus be most important in the seedling stage and decrease with ontogeny. Journal of Ecology (2005)doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2745.2005.01070.x},

  abstract = {1. Plant interactions play a central role in regulating plant communities and this role can be altered by abiotic stress. With increasing stress, ecological theory predicts that the role of competition decreases whilst that of facilitation increases. Such predictions have been tested with short-term plant removal experiments using two distinct indices evaluating the role of plant interactions: the intensity (absolute impact) and the importance (impact relative to that of other abiotic constraints) of plant interactions. 2. Using data on individual tree radial growth from more than 17 000 forest plots covering the habitat conditions of 16 species in the Alps and the Jura mountains of France, we show that non-manipulative estimates of plant interactions provide an alternative to this experimental approach. We developed a Bayesian neighbourhood growth competition model to test theoretical predictions about plant–plant interactions with a much larger spatio-temporal scope and set of study species than classically used in experimental studies of plant–plant interactions. 3. Our analyses revealed that competition – measured as neighbours effects on adult tree growth – varies in importance but not in intensity along two major bioclimatic gradients (degree-day sum and water availability). Observed patterns of competition importance differed between shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant tree species. First, the mean importance of competition was found to be much higher for shade-intolerant species. Second, for shade-intolerant species the importance of competition remained high even at low crowding indices (i.e. at a low competitor density), whereas for shade-tolerant species competition only became important at high crowding indices. 4. Synthesis. Our non-manipulative approach to the study of plant–plant interactions allows analysing interactions among many species over large climatic gradients. Our results clearly demonstrate that a quantitative estimation of density dependence effects is key to understanding how plant–plant interactions vary along abiotic gradients. Growth predictions derived from our model can easily be integrated with other results on tree regeneration and mortality in individual-based models to investigate how plant–plant interactions drive tree population and community dynamics under varying climatic conditions.},

  abstract = {A trade-off between growth in high-light and survival in low-light of species is often proposed as a key mechanism underpinning the dynamics of trees in forest communities. Yet, growth and survival are known to depend on plant size and few studies have analysed how this trade-off can vary between juvenile life stages and the potential consequences of the trade-off for the differences in regeneration rate between species in mixed forests. We quantified growth and mortality for two different juvenile life stages 2013 seedlings and saplings 2013 of seven tree species common in temperate rain forests in New Zealand using data from field studies. We found strong evidence that the ranking of species for survival in shade and growth in full light was affected by size. There was a trade-off between seedling survival in low light and sapling height growth in high light, but no trade-offs were observed when considering other combinations of life stages (seedling growth vs. seedling survival, seedling growth vs. sapling survival, or sapling growth vs. sapling survival). We ran simulations with an individual-based forest dynamics model 2013 {SORTIE/NZ} 2013 to explore how the trade-off drives the differences in tree species regeneration success in gaps vs. under closed forest conditions. These simulations indicate that because species' ranks in shade tolerance varied with life stage, regeneration success was not predicted from knowledge of tree performance at a single life stage. For instance, high-light sapling growth was a strong determinant of regeneration success in forest gaps, but seedling growth was also influential. Under closed forest, regeneration success was primarily limited by low-light mortality at the seedling stage, but seedling growth and sapling survival were also influential. Synthesis. Growth-survival trade-offs can be strongly affected by the size of the individual analysed, resulting in completely different rankings of the shade tolerance of species across different juvenile life stages. Performance of both seedlings and saplings influenced regeneration success, highlighting the need to consider growth-survival trade-offs and the shade-tolerance strategies of tree species over a large range of juvenile sizes.},

When grown under optimum conditions, plant species from fertile, productive habitats tend to have inherently higher relative growth rates ({RGR}) than species from less favorable environments. The traits of a “typical fast-growing” and a “typical slow-growing” plant species are described. Fast-growing species have higher respiration rates per unit organ weight, due to demands of a higher {RGR} and higher rate of nutrient uptake. Fast-growing species have a greater capacity to acquire nutrients, which is likely to be a consequence of their higher {RGR}. The chapter analyzes variation in morphological, physiological, chemical, and allocation characteristics underlying variation in {RGR}. The lower specific leaf area ({SLA}) of slow-growing species is at least partly due to the relatively high concentration of cell-wall material and quantitative secondary compounds, which may protect against detrimental abiotic and biotic factors.},

The effects of plant size on self-shading and light interception have rarely been quantified, however. We used a three-dimensional digitising system to construct virtual models of the architecture of Araucaria araucana seedlings 71 to 358 mm tall, and modelled their light interception in the forest understorey using the program {YPLANT.} We also analyzed seedling allometry, to determine the combined effects of biomass distribution and self-shading on total light interception. Average light interception efficiencies calculated for A. araucana (29 \%) were the lowest reported for rainforest tree seedlings, reflecting the limitations imposed by short leaves, lack of petioles and an inability to develop planar foliage geometry on branches. Total light interception was related to seedling leaf area by an exponent of 0.735, reflecting increasing self-shading as seedlings grew bigger. However, because leaf area was related to seedling mass by an exponent of 1.24, light interception scaled nearly isometrically (0.91 power) with seedling mass. This resulted from taller plants having proportionally thinner stems, and a smaller fraction of their biomass in roots. Thus, an ontogenetic increase in self-shading in A. araucana is largely offset by allocation changes which increase leaf area ratio as seedlings grow bigger. These mechanisms conserving the relationship of light interception with plant mass seem likely to be restricted to species with long-lived leaves, growing in humid situations protected from wind stress. In open habitats, where wind and drought stress likely make such allocation patterns less feasible, the role of self-shading in ontogenetic declines in relative growth rate may be more evident.},

  abstract = {Summary 1. Although shade tolerance is often assumed to be a fixed trait of species, recent work has reported size-related changes in the relative and absolute light requirements of woody taxa. We hypothesized that, in evergreen forests, light requirements of shade-tolerant species that accumulate multiple foliage cohorts will be more stable during juvenile ontogeny than those of intolerant species with short leaf lifetimes. 2. We quantified the light environments occupied by three size classes of 13 coexisting evergreens in a temperate rainforest, to determine how size influenced their relative shade tolerance. Minimum light requirements ({MLRs)} of species were estimated by computing the 10th percentile of the distribution of juveniles in relation to percentage canopy openness, for each size class. Leaf life span in low light (2\%-5\% canopy openness) was estimated by recording survival of marked leaves over 12 months, or retrospectively on species with clearly discernible foliage cohorts. 3. Agreement of ranks of species’ {MLR} across size classes was significant, although not strong (Kendall's W = 0.159, P = 0.02). {MLRs} of the most shade-tolerant species changed little between size-classes, whereas those of most of the less-tolerant species rose with increasing size. 4. Shift in {MLR} across size-classes was negatively correlated with leaf life span, possibly because of the effects of leaf life span on biomass distribution and whole-plant carbon balance. Survival of light-demanding species with short leaf lifetimes may thus depend on their encountering increasing light levels as they grow taller, whereas progressive accumulation of an extensive leaf area by late-successional taxa enables them to continue to tolerate low light despite increasing size. 5. Results suggest that shade-tolerance differences between evergreens become increasingly apparent with increasing size. In identifying a relationship with leaf life span, this work also provides a basis for predicting changes in species’ light requirements during juvenile ontogeny.},

  abstract = {The scaling of respiratory metabolism with body mass is one of the most pervasive phenomena in biology. Using a single allometric equation to characterize empirical scaling relationships and to evaluate alternative hypotheses about mechanisms has been controversial. We developed a method to directly measure respiration of 271 whole plants, spanning nine orders of magnitude in body mass, from small seedlings to large trees, and from tropical to boreal ecosystems. Our measurements include the roots, which have often been ignored. Rather than a single power-law relationship, our data are fit by a biphasic, mixed-power function. The allometric exponent varies continuously from 1 in the smallest plants to 3/4 in larger saplings and trees. Therefore, our findings support the recent findings of Reich et al.

  abstract = {Defining ‘plants’ inclusively as ‘photosynthetic eukaryotes’, four basic body plans are identifiable among plant lineages (unicellular, siphonous, colonial and multicellular). All of these body plans occur in most plant lineages, but only the multicellular body plan was carried onto land by the embryophytes. Extensive morphological and anatomical homoplasy is evident among species with different body plans. This is ascribed to the facts that the acquisition of nutrients and radiant energy is affected by plant body size, shape and geometry, and that, with the exception of the unicellular body plan, each of the other body plans involves an ‘open and indeterminate’ ontogeny capable of modifying body size, shape and geometry regardless of how organized growth is achieved. In terms of unicellular species, the available data indicate that size-dependent variations in surface area, metabolic constituents (e.g. photosynthetic pigments), and reproductive rates limit maximum body size in nutrient poor habitats or those that change rapidly or unpredictably. This maximum size can be exceeded in more stable niches by either the cooperation of conspecific cells sharing a common extracellular matrix (i.e. the ‘colonial’ body plan) or by repeated mitotic cellular division associated with sustained cytoplasmic (symplastic) continuity (i.e. multicellularity). The siphonous plant body plan may have been evolutionarily derived from a unicellular or multicellular ancestral life form. Each of the plant body plans is reviewed in terms of its biomechanical advantages and disadvantages. Variants of the multicellular body plan, especially those of the Chlorophyta, Charophyta, and Embryophyta, are given special emphasis.},

Leaf morphology was compared between the harvested and litter leaves for trees of various heights. Also, litter traps were set systematically around the trees of various heights, and distribution patterns were investigated for litter leaves. Leaf area and dry weight decreased with increasing height in a similar manner in both leaf litter and harvested leaves. This suggests that median crown height can be estimated from mean area or mass of the leaf litter of a tree in this species. Furthermore, horizontal distribution patterns of litter leaves were well explained by the Gaussian kernel. Leaf fall rate was estimated to be 2.0–28.1\&\#xa0;kg per tree per year in the five trees of various heights, and was greater in taller trees. Since leaf life span was smaller for taller trees, leaf biomass was estimated to be 2.6–30.5\&\#xa0;kg per tree, and was also greater in taller trees. These estimated values are similar to the values estimated from the allometric equation that uses the diameter at breast height and overall tree height as parameters.},

  volume = {21},
  abstract = {Understanding co-adapted traits and strategies in organisms has been increasingly shown to require a broader view of structure, function, taxonomic affiliation (phylogeny) and their possible interactions. In order to understand mechanisms of recruitment dynamics in tropical forest, nine juvenile (fruit, seed and seedling) and seven adult ecological and morphological traits were examined in 89 woody plant species, from 75 genera, 35 families and 21 orders. The species were from tropical rainforest in northern Queensland and varied widely in light requirements and hence regeneration niches. The importance of taxonomic (phylogenetic) constraints was considered using various techniques. Data were collected mostly from herbarium specimens, augmented by observations in the field. The main source of variation in most traits was at the species level, although fruit size and light requirement varied most at the genus level, and flower size at the level of order. Covariation among attributes increased in strength with increasing taxonomic level. Cluster analyses of the species arising either from five or three groups reflected juvenile rather than adult attributes. However, these groups were not morphologically distinct. Sets of juvenile traits poorly predict adult functions (and vice-versa) at species, genus and family levels, but do so more strongly at the order level. Analyses of variance and multivariate analyses, with and without the effects of phylogeny, indicated that fruit size, seed size, hardness of seed coat, seedling cotyledon function, fruit maturation period and, to a lesser extent, seed number per fruit and wood density could predict light requirement, and hence regeneration niche. Flower size showed a strong phylogenetic effect, and thus is conserved along taxonomic lines. It is concluded that as different traits may vary at different taxonomic levels, the influence of phylogeny on interspecific variation needs to be routinely recognized by ecologists involved in comparative analyses of plant life-history functions.},

  title = {Architecture of 54 moist forest tree species: traits, trade-offs, and functional groups},
  volume = {87},
  abstract = {Tree architecture is an important determinant of the height extension, light capture, and mechanical stability of trees, and it allows species to exploit the vertical height gradient in the forest canopy and horizontal light gradients at the forest floor. Tropical tree species partition these gradients through variation in adult stature (Hmax) and light demand. In this study we compare 22 architectural traits for 54 Bolivian moist-forest tree species. We evaluate how architectural traits related to Hmax vary with tree size, and we present a conceptual scheme in which we combine the two axes into four different functional groups. Interspecific correlations between architecture and Hmax varied strongly from negative to positive, depending on the reference sizes used. Stem height was positively related to Hmax at larger reference diameters (14–80 cm). Species height vs. diameter curves often flattened toward their upper ends in association with reproductive maturity for species of all sizes. Thus, adult understory trees were typically shorter than similar-diameter juveniles of larger species. Crown area was negatively correlated with Hmax at small reference heights and positively correlated at larger reference heights (15–34 m). Wide crowns allow the small understory species to intercept light over a large area at the expense of a reduced height growth. Crown length was negatively correlated with Hmax at intermediate reference heights (4–14 m). A long crown enables small understory species to maximize light interception in a light-limited environment. Light-demanding species were characterized by orthotropic stems and branches, large leaves, and a monolayer leaf arrangement. They realized an efficient height growth through the formation of narrow and shallow crowns. Light demand turned out to be a much stronger predictor of tree architecture than Hmax, probably because of the relatively low, open, and semi-evergreen canopy at the research site. The existence of four functional groups (shade-tolerant, partial-shade-tolerant, and long- and short-lived pioneer) was confirmed by the principal component and discriminant analysis. Both light demand and Hmax capture the major variation in functional traits found among tropical rain forest tree species, and the two-way classification scheme provides a straightforward model to understand niche differentiation in tropical forests.},

  abstract = {A central goal of comparative plant ecology is to understand how functional traits vary among species and to what extent this variation has adaptive value. Here we evaluate relationships between four functional traits (seed volume, specific leaf area, wood density, and adult stature) and two demographic attributes (diameter growth and tree mortality) for large trees of 240 tree species from five Neotropical forests. We evaluate how these key functional traits are related to survival and growth and whether similar relationships between traits and demography hold across different tropical forests. There was a tendency for a trade-off between growth and survival across rain forest tree species. Wood density, seed volume, and adult stature were significant predictors of growth and/or mortality. Both growth and mortality rates declined with an increase in wood density. This is consistent with greater construction costs and greater resistance to stem damage for denser wood. Growth and mortality rates also declined as seed volume increased. This is consistent with an adaptive syndrome in which species tolerant of low resource availability (in this case shade-tolerant species) have large seeds to establish successfully and low inherent growth and mortality rates. Growth increased and mortality decreased with an increase in adult stature, because taller species have a greater access to light and longer life spans. Specific leaf area was, surprisingly, only modestly informative for the performance of large trees and had ambiguous relationships with growth and survival. Single traits accounted for 9-55\% of the interspecific variation in growth and mortality rates at individual sites. Significant correlations with demographic rates tended to be similar across forests and for phylogenetically independent contrasts as well as for cross-species analyses that treated each species as an independent observation. In combination, the morphological traits explained 41\% of the variation in growth rate and 54\% of the variation in mortality rate, with wood density being the best predictor of growth and mortality. Relationships between functional traits and demographic rates were statistically similar across a wide range of Neotropical forests. The consistency of these results strongly suggests that tropical rain forest species face similar trade-offs in different sites and converge on similar sets of solutions.},

  abstract = {In many plant communities, there is a negative interspecific correlation between relative growth rates and survival of juveniles. This negative correlation is most likely caused by a trade-off between carbon allocation to growth vs. allocation to defense and storage. Nonstructural carbohydrates ({NSC)} stored in stems allow plants to overcome periods of stress and should enhance survival. In order to assess how species differ in carbohydrate storage in relation to juvenile light requirements, growth, and survival, we quantified {NSC} concentrations and pool sizes in sapling stems of 85 woody species in moist semi-evergreen and dry deciduous tropical forests in the rainy season in {Bolivia.Moist} forest species averaged higher {NSC} concentrations than dry forest species. Carbohydrate concentrations and pool sizes decreased with the light requirements of juveniles of the species in the moist forest but not in the dry forest. Combined, these results suggest that storage is especially important for species that regenerate in persistently shady habitats, as in the understory of moist evergreen {forests.For} moist forest species, sapling survival rates increased with {NSC} concentrations and pool sizes while growth rates declined with the {NSC} concentrations and pool sizes. No relationships were found for dry forest species. Carbon allocation to storage contributes to the growth–survival trade-off through its positive effect on survival. And, a continuum in carbon storage strategies contributes to a continuum in light requirements among species. The link between storage and light requirements is especially strong in moist evergreen forest where species sort out along a light gradient, but disappears in dry deciduous forest where light is a less limiting resource and species sort out along drought and fire gradients.},

  abstract = {We compared the leaf traits and plant performance of 53 co-occurring tree species in a semi-evergreen tropical moist forest community. The species differed in all leaf traits analyzed: leaf life span varied 11-fold among species, specific leaf area 5-fold, mass-based nitrogen 3-fold, mass-based assimilation rate 13-fold, mass-based respiration rate 15-fold, stomatal conductance 8-fold, and photosynthetic water use efficiency 4-fold. Photosynthetic traits were strongly coordinated, and specific leaf area predicted mass-based rates of assimilation and respiration; leaf life span predicted many other leaf characteristics. Leaf traits were closely associated with growth, survival, and light requirement of the species.

Leaf investment strategies varied on a continuum trading off short-term carbon gain against long-term leaf persistence that, in turn, is linked to variation in whole-plant growth and survival. Leaf traits were good predictors of plant performance, both in gaps and in the forest understory. High growth in gaps is promoted by cheap, short-lived, and physiologically active leaves. High survival in the forest understory is enhanced by the formation of long-lived well protected leaves that reduce biomass loss by herbivory, mechanical disturbance, or leaf turnover. Leaf traits underlay this growth–survival trade-off; species with short-lived, physiologically active leaves have high growth but low survival. This continuum in leaf traits, through its effect on plant performance, in turn gives rise to a continuum in species' light requirements.},

Growth is typically characterized by relative growth rate ({RGR);} however, {RGR} often declines as organisms get larger, making it difficult to compare species of different sizes. To overcome this problem, we advocate using nonlinear mixed‐effects models so that {RGR} can be calculated at a standard size, and we present easily implemented methods for doing this. We then present new methods for analyzing the traditional components of {RGR} that explicitly allow for the fact that is the sum of its components. These methods provide an exact decomposition of the variance in .

  abstract = {* The leaf economics spectrum ({LES}) provides a useful framework for examining species strategies as shaped by their evolutionary history. However, that spectrum, as originally described, involved only two key resources (carbon and nutrients) and one of three economically important plant organs. Herein, I evaluate whether the economics spectrum idea can be broadly extended to water – the third key resource –stems, roots and entire plants and to individual, community and ecosystem scales. My overarching hypothesis is that strong selection along trait trade-off axes, in tandem with biophysical constraints, results in convergence for any taxon on a uniformly fast, medium or slow strategy (i.e. rates of resource acquisition and processing) for all organs and all resources. * Evidence for economic trait spectra exists for stems and roots as well as leaves, and for traits related to water as well as carbon and nutrients. These apply generally within and across scales (within and across communities, climate zones, biomes and lineages). * There are linkages across organs and coupling among resources, resulting in an integrated whole-plant economics spectrum. Species capable of moving water rapidly have low tissue density, short tissue life span and high rates of resource acquisition and flux at organ and individual scales. The reverse is true for species with the slow strategy. Different traits may be important in different conditions, but as being fast in one respect generally requires being fast in others, being fast or slow is a general feature of species. * Economic traits influence performance and fitness consistent with trait-based theory about underlying adaptive mechanisms. Traits help explain differences in growth and survival across resource gradients and thus help explain the distribution of species and the assembly of communities across light, water and nutrient gradients. Traits scale up – fast traits are associated with faster rates of ecosystem processes such as decomposition or primary productivity, and slow traits with slow process rates. * Synthesis. Traits matter. A single ‘fast–slow’ plant economics spectrum that integrates across leaves, stems and roots is a key feature of the plant universe and helps to explain individual ecological strategies, community assembly processes and the functioning of ecosystems.},

Light reaching each individual tree was estimated from yearly vertical censuses of vegetation density. Across the community, 78\% of the species showed increasing mortality with increasing light. Considering species individually, just 29 species showed a significant response to light, all with increasing mortality at high light. Past growth had a significant impact on all but three species, with higher growth leading to lower mortality. For the majority of species, mortality decreased sharply with diameter in saplings, then levelled off or increased slightly towards the maximum diameter of the species. Diameter had the biggest impact on mortality, followed by past growth and finally light availability. Our results challenge many previous reports of higher mortality in shade, and we suggest that it is crucial to control for size effects when assessing the impact of environmental conditions on mortality.},

2.  We use a hierarchical Bayesian approach to quantify the light dependence of recruitment in 263 woody species in a 50-ha long-term forest census plot in Panama. Data on sapling recruitment were obtained using the 1985–1990 and 1990–1995 census intervals. Available light was estimated for each recruit from yearly censuses of canopy density.

3.  We use a power function (linear log–log relationship) to model the light effect on recruitment. Different responses of recruitment to light are expressed by the light effect parameter b. The distribution of b had a central mode at 0.8, suggesting that recruitment of many species responds nearly linearly to increasing light.

4.  Nearly every species showed increases in recruitment with increasing light. Just nine species (3\%) had recruitment declining with light, while 198 species (75\%) showed increasing recruitment in both census intervals. Most of the increases in recruitment were decelerating, i.e. the increase was less at higher light (b {\textless} 1). In the remaining species, the response to light varied between census intervals (24 species) or species did not have recruits in both intervals (41 species).

5.  Synthesis. Nearly all species regenerate better in higher light, and recruitment responses to light are spread along a continuum ranging from modest increase with light to a rather strict requirement for high light. These results support the hypothesis that spatio-temporal variation in light availability may contribute to the diversity of tropical tree species by providing opportunities for niche differentiation with respect to light requirements for regeneration.},

Light reaching each individual tree was estimated from yearly vertical censuses of canopy density, and a hierarchical Bayesian approach allowed quantifying confidence intervals for scaling exponents and accounting for different sources of error.3. We found no universal scaling relationship, and 50–70\% of the species had scaling exponents that significantly differed from the predicted value of 1/3. As would be expected if competition for light were important, scaling exponents were {\textgreater}1/3 for the majority of species when all trees were combined. However, the community average of scaling exponents was not significantly different from the predicted value of 1/3 when only considering individuals that grew under high-light conditions.4. These results support the hypothesis that the prediction of metabolic ecology for the scaling of tree growth with size is only valid when competition for light is unimportant.},

  abstract = {How long forest trees can sustain wood production with increasing age remains an open question, primarily because whole-crown structure and growth cannot be readily measured from the ground or on felled trees. We climbed and directly measured crown structures and growth rates of 43 un-suppressed individuals (site trees) of the two tallest species – Eucalyptus regnans and Sequoia sempervirens – representing a wide range of tree sizes and ages. In both species, ground-level measurements of annual growth, including height, ring width, and basal area increment, exhibited the oft-reported trend of decreasing growth (or no change in growth) with age, yet wood production of the entire main trunk and whole crown both increased with size and age up to and including the largest and oldest trees we measured. The balance between structural metrics of whole-crown respiratory demands (cambium area, inner bark volume, sapwood volume, and heartwood deposition area) and photosynthetic capacity (leaf area and green bark area) was statistically independent of size but not age. After accounting for the effect of size, trees with lower potential respiratory demands grew more than trees with higher potential respiratory demands per unit photosynthetic area. The strongest determinant of tree energy balance was the ratio of aboveground cambium area to leaf area. Among the site trees we examined, over 85\% of the variation in annual wood production was explained by variation in size, and the proportion of total aboveground wood production in appendages (branches, limbs, and reiterated trunks) increased linearly with size. With increasing age in both species, the proportion of annual wood production converted to heartwood increased in main trunks and appendages. The oldest tree we measured produced more heartwood in its main trunk over 651 years (351\&\#xa0;m3) than contained in any tree we measured \&lt;1500 years old. The two tallest tree species achieve similar stature despite divergent growth dynamics and ecologies. At one extreme, E. regnans attains great size quickly but dies relatively young because trees are susceptible to fire and fungi. At the other extreme, S. sempervirens attains great size more slowly but has a long lifespan because trees resist fire and prioritize investment in decay-resistant heartwood. Increasing wood production as trees age is a mechanism underlying the maintenance of biomass accumulation during forest development and the carbon-sink capacity of old-growth forests.},

  abstract = {Forests are major components of the global carbon cycle, providing substantial feedback to atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Our ability to understand and predict changes in the forest carbon cycle—particularly net primary productivity and carbon storage—increasingly relies on models that represent biological processes across several scales of biological organization, from tree leaves to forest stands. Yet, despite advances in our understanding of productivity at the scales of leaves and stands, no consensus exists about the nature of productivity at the scale of the individual tree, in part because we lack a broad empirical assessment of whether rates of absolute tree mass growth (and thus carbon accumulation) decrease, remain constant, or increase as trees increase in size and age. Here we present a global analysis of 403 tropical and temperate tree species, showing that for most species mass growth rate increases continuously with tree size. Thus, large, old trees do not act simply as senescent carbon reservoirs but actively fix large amounts of carbon compared to smaller trees; at the extreme, a single big tree can add the same amount of carbon to the forest within a year as is contained in an entire mid-sized tree. The apparent paradoxes of individual tree growth increasing with tree size despite declining leaf-level and stand-level productivity can be explained, respectively, by increases in a tree/'s total leaf area that outpace declines in productivity per unit of leaf area and, among other factors, age-related reductions in population density. Our results resolve conflicting assumptions about the nature of tree growth, inform efforts to undertand and model forest carbon dynamics, and have additional implications for theories of resource allocation and plant senescence.},

  volume = {80},
  abstract = {Comparative studies of photosynthetic physiology in rain forest trees have focused on differences related to successional status, with the general finding that early-successional species tend to show physiological characteristics of sun plants, while late-successional species show shade-plant characteristics. The present study examines analogous evolutionary responses to vertical gradients in light availability, through an analysis of patterns of photosynthetic variation among late-successional tropical tree species that differ in adult stature. Larger statured tree species are expected to have higher values for light-saturated photosynthetic rate (A(max)) as adults, due to the inevitable gradient in light availability through the canopy. However, we argue that larger statured species should also show a higher A(max), and other {"}sun-plant{"} characteristics, as saplings under relatively uniform low light conditions in the forest understory. This prediction follows if the potential for photosynthetic acclimation is finite, and if developmental processes that determine adult-phase physiology also affect the physiology of sapling leaves. We examined relationships between photosynthetic parameters and tree species' stature using comparative data on 28 late-successional species at Pasoh Forest Reserve, West Malaysia. Species chosen for study represent four genera that each include taxa ranging in size from understory treelets to canopy-level trees, thus enabling {"}phylogenetically corrected{"} analyses and stronger inference that observed patterns reflect evolutionary convergence. A,,, of understory saplings, as measured on a leaf area, mass, or nitrogen basis, was positively correlated with asymptotic height (H-max) reached by mature trees of a given species. These relationships were similar in each of the four main study genera, thus supporting the hypothesis of an evolutionary response in photosynthetic characteristics to the vertical gradient in light availability through the canopy. Understory species also commonly exhibited higher leaf-level photosynthetic rates at low light levels than did canopy species within a given genus; however, such {"}crosses{"} in photosynthetic light response curves were only pronounced when photosynthesis was expressed on a leaf mass basis. Midcanopy leaves from adult trees displayed A(max)(area) values similar to leaves from understory saplings of a given species, while A(max)(mass) values for adult trees were lower than those of saplings. This pattern corresponded to lower values for specific leaf area in adult trees than in saplings, a difference that was systematically greater in larger statured species. In sum, a range of both adult tree and sapling physiological parameters, including photosynthetic capacity, light saturation point, and leaf nitrogen content, may be predicted as a function of asymptotic species height. Previous research on vertical gradients in photosynthetic characteristics of forest trees has focused on proximate mechanisms, such as light acclimation responses and nutrient reallocation within individual tree canopies, The present study documents evolved differences among species that also contribute to the overall pattern of photosynthetic variation within forest canopies. Our results suggest that much of the variation in leaf-level physiology among late-successional tropical trees is related to an evolved sun-shade trade-off that corresponds to differences in size among species.

  abstract = {Studies of age-related changes in leaf functional biology have generally been based on dichotomous comparisons of young and mature individuals (e.g., saplings and mature canopy trees), with little data available to describe changes through the entire ontogeny of trees, particularly of broadleaf angiosperms. Leaf-level gas-exchange and morphological parameters were quantified in situ in the upper canopy of trees acclimated to high light conditions, spanning a wide range of ontogenetic stages from saplings ({\textasciitilde}1 cm in stem diameter) to trees {\textgreater}60 cm d.b.h. and nearing their maximum lifespan, in three temperate deciduous tree species in central Ontario, Canada. Traits associated with growth performance, including leaf photosynthetic capacity (expressed on either an area, mass or leaf N basis), stomatal conductance, leaf size and leaf N content, generally showed a unimodal ( hump-shaped') pattern, with peak values at an intermediate ontogenetic stage. In contrast, leaf mass per area ({LMA)} and related morphological parameters (leaf thickness, leaf tissue density, leaf C content) increased monotonically with tree size, as did water-use efficiency; these monotonic relationships were well described by simple allometric functions of the form Y = {aXb.} For traits showing unimodal patterns, tree size corresponding to the trait maximum differed markedly among traits: all three species showed a similar pattern in which the peak for leaf size occurred in trees {\textasciitilde}2-6 cm d.b.h., followed by leaf chemical traits and photosynthetic capacity on a mass or leaf N basis and finally by photosynthetic capacity on a leaf area basis, which peaked approximately at the size of reproductive onset. It is argued that ontogenetic increases in photosynthetic capacity and related traits early in tree ontogeny are general among relatively shade-tolerant tree species that have a low capacity for leaf-level acclimation, as are declines in this set of traits late in tree ontogeny.},

We develop theory for {SA}:{LA} and also for root surface area per leaf area ({RA}:{LA}) on the premise that plants maximizing the surplus of revenue over costs should have competitive advantage. {SA}:{LA} is predicted to increase in water-relations environments that reduce photosynthetic revenue, including low soil water potential, high water vapor pressure deficit ({VPD}), and low atmospheric {CO}2. Because sapwood has costs, {SA}:{LA} adjustment does not completely offset difficult water relations. Where sapwood costs are large, as in tall plants, optimal {SA}:{LA} may actually decline with (say) high {VPD}. Large soil-to-root resistance caps the benefits that can be obtained from increasing {SA}:{LA}. Where a plant can adjust water-absorbing surface area of root per leaf area ({RA}:{LA}) as well as {SA}:{LA}, optimal {RA}:{SA} is not affected by {VPD}, {CO}2 or plant height. If selection favours increased height more so than increased revenue-minus-cost, then height is predicted to rise substantially under improved water-relations environments such as high-{CO}2 atmospheres. Evolutionary-attractor theory for {SA}:{LA} and {RA}:{LA} complements models that take whole-plant conductivity per leaf area as a parameter.},

Recent comparative data make it possible to quantify the cross-species trade-off between the first variable and the second variable. Here we develop an approach through which the consequences of the third variable, the time-discount rate, can be related to the trade-off between the first variable and the second variable. The approach involves an equal-benefit set, the cross-species equivalent of a fitness set. A wide spread of strategies is actually observed to coexist in vegetation, from low to high light capture area per gram and, correspondingly, from high to low leaf longevity. The coexistence suggests that the different observed strategies do not have a clear-cut advantage over the other. The equal-benefit set can be used to investigate what levels of time discount would make it the case that neither the highest-longevity nor the highest light-capture area per milligram strategies would have a clear advantage over the other, with regard to the time-discounted value of the revenue stream generated per milligram invested in leaf.

Acer saccharum, Betula lutea, and Fagus grandifolia are dominant, but toward higher elevations Picea rubens and Abies balsamea also occur and indicate the transition toward subalpine climate. The stands are young (following cutting in 1909-17) but contain older trees; stand composition is thought reasonably representative of the climax. For application of the Brookhaven system of forest dimension analysis, 93 sample trees of major species were cut and roots excavated. Mean dimensions of sample trees, and the constants for the system of logarithmic regressions relating volume, surface, mass, and growth to diameter at breast height and other independent variables, show decrease in tree sizes and height/diameter ratios toward higher elevations. Stand characteristics, based on application of the regressions to forest samples, show trends of decrease for the elevation belts from low to high: stem basal area 26.3, 23.7, and 22.0 m{\textasciicircum}2/ha, weighted mean tree height 16.9, 16.7, and 10.8 m, weighted mean age 124, 95, and 83 yr, stem wood volume 176, 155, and 103 m{\textasciicircum}3/ha, aboveground biomass (dry matter) 162, 152, and 102 t/ha, estimated volume increment 379, 365, and 223 cm{\textasciicircum}3/m{\textasciicircum}2/yr, aboveground net primary productivity (1956-60) 1127, 1041, and 790 g/m{\textasciicircum}2/yr, and leaf area ratio 6.2, 5.7, and 5.5 m{\textasciicircum}2/m{\textasciicircum}2. Biomass (and, presumably, production) of root systems is 18\%-21\% of that aboveground. Different estimations suggest that a mean climax biomass for the watershed may be around 350 t/ha, aboveground. Net ecosystem production (i.e., addition to the pool of woody biomass in the community) is estimated as 350 g/m{\textasciicircum}2/yr aboveground and 85 belowground for 1956-60, 238 and 52 g/m{\textasciicircum}2/yr for 1961-65. Analysis of stem wood volume increments reveals an abrupt and striking (18\%) decrease in volume growth and productivity from 1956-60 to 1961-65. The net primary productivity of the former period, with a weighted mean for the watershed of 1110 g/m{\textasciicircum}2/yr above and below the ground, is thought more nearly normal for the forest. Both drought and effects of increasing air pollution (notably increasing acidity of rainfall) may be responsible for the recent decrease in productivity.},

Franco) stand in the western Cascade Range of southern Washington. All tree-ring samples were prepared and crossdated. Following a stand-replacing fire, the stand initiation period lasted from 1500 to 1540, with gradual filling-in of growing space over this period. All sampled Douglas-fir were initial colonizers, establishing (at stump-height) 1500–1521 under open conditions. A small number of the sampled western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.) were also initial colonizers. Growing space filled as tree crowns widened, and by 1540, closed forest conditions had developed. At this time, Douglas-fir were spaced about 3.5 m from equivalent competitors (ca. 800 trees/ha). In the centuries following canopy closure, considerable natural thinning of the initial colonizers occurred, but the canopy never opened enough again to allow further Douglas-fir establishment. Surviving Douglas-fir developed deep crowns despite the narrow initial spacing, and without epicormic branching from the bole. Most western hemlock that were canopy trees in 1992 established after 1540, originating in the understory. This reconstruction provides an example that may be useful where management policies emphasize the development of old-growth structures.},

  abstract = {1. Seedling relative growth rate ({RGR)} is often decomposed into the product of specific leaf area (leaf area per leaf mass, {SLA)}, net assimilation rate (rate of mass increase per unit leaf area per unit time, {NARa)} and leaf mass ratio (ratio of leaf to total dry mass, {LMR).} Commonly, most cross-species variation in {RGR} is accounted for by variation in {SLA}, while no general relationships occur between {RGR} and either {NARa} or {LMR.} {NARa} can be factored into the product of leaf nitrogen productivity (rate of mass increase per unit leaf nitrogen per unit time, {LNP)} and leaf nitrogen concentration (area basis, {LNCa).} In this way the influence on {RGR} of leaf nitrogen - how it is displayed, and how it is utilized - can be investigated. 2. Seedlings of 28 Australian woody dicot species were grown under controlled, favourable conditions. Variation in {SLA}, {LNP}, {LNCa} and {LMR} explained c. 44\%, 22\%, 19\% and 15\% of variation in {RGR}, respectively. {SLA} and {LNP} were positively associated with {RGR}, while {LNCa} was negatively associated with {RGR.} {LNP} and {LNCa} were negatively correlated, the counteracting trends between {RGR} and each of these attributes resulting in no relationship between {RGR} and {NARa.} It is argued that this phenomenon may be widespread and may contribute to the inconsistency of reported relationships between {NARa} and {RGR.} 3. The functional balance between leaves and roots can be described in terms of mass allocation and morphology (static ratios or allometric coefficients) or, alternatively, in terms of leaf 'activity' ({NAR)} and root 'activity' (nitrogen uptake rate, {NUR).} At any given time most species allocated greater mass to leaves than to roots, but species with low {RGR} tended to be partitioning a greater ongoing proportion of new biomass to the roots rather than to the leaves, resulting in a proportionally greater increase in root surface compared with leaf surface over time. Nitrogen uptake rate was correlated with leaf and whole-plant nitrogen concentration, but not with other attributes. While it is clear that root and leaf functions must be coordinated (and thus in balance) for growth to occur, there is little evidence that this balance varies systematically with {RGR} across all species.},

Seed mass, {LMA}, {WD}, and Hmax are predicted to be small for light-demanding species with rapid growth and mortality and large for shade-tolerant species with slow growth and mortality. Six of these trait–demographic rate predictions were realized for saplings; however, with the exception of {WD}, the relationships were weak (r2 {\textless} 0.1 for three and r2 {\textless} 0.2 for five of the six remaining relationships). The four traits together explained 43–44\% of interspecific variation in species positions on the growth–mortality trade-off; however, {WD} alone accounted for {\textgreater}80\% of the explained variation and, after {WD} was included, {LMA} and Hmax made insignificant contributions. Virtually the full range of values of {SM}, {LMA}, and Hmax occurred at all positions on the growth–mortality trade-off. Although {WD} provides a promising start, a successful trait-based ecology of tropical forest trees will require consideration of additional traits.},

  abstract = {Summary 1 Slow growth is associated with high mortality risk for trees, but few data exist to assess interspecific differences in the relationship between growth and mortality. Here we compare low growth tolerance for seven co-occurring species in the southern Appalachian Mountains: Acer rubrum, Betula lenta, Cornus florida, Liriodendron tulipifera, Quercus prinus, Quercus rubra and Robinia pseudo-acacia. 2 For all species, mortality was greater for understorey individuals than for canopy trees. Species varied widely in the length of growth decline prior to death, ranging from 6 years for L. tulipifera to more than 12 years for Q. rubra. 3 Growth-mortality functions differ among species, but we found little evidence of a trade-off between tolerance of slow growth and an ability to show rapid growth in high light conditions. 4 A. rubrum stands out in its ability both to grow rapidly and to tolerate slow growth, suggesting that its density may increase at our study site as in other parts of the eastern United States. In contrast, C. florida shows high mortality (15\% per annum) as a result of infection with dogwood anthracnose. 5 We modified a forest simulation model, {LINKAGES} (which assumes that all species have the same ability to tolerate slow growth), to include our functions relating growth and mortality. The modified model gives radically altered predictions, reinforcing the need to rethink and re-parameterize existing computer models with field data.},

  abstract = {We address the relationships between tree growth rate and growing environment for 21 co-occurring species. Tree growth rates are obtained from mapped plots at the Coweeta Long-Term Ecological Research site in the southern Appalachian Mountains. We employ high-resolution aerial photography to assess the light environment for trees growing in these plots, using exposed crown area ({ECA)} as a surrogate for light interception. The relationship between growth and {ECA} is compared with two other growth predictors: tree size and shade-tolerance classification. We find that {ECA} is an excellent predictor of tree growth (average R2=0.69 for nine species). When {ECA} is combined with tree size, growth rate prediction is improved (average R2=0.76). Tree size alone is also a strong predictor of tree growth (average R2=0.68). Shade-tolerance classification, by contrast, is a poor predictor of tree growth.},

  volume = {76},
  abstract = {The relationships between vertical foliage profile of an individual plant, competition between individuals, size structure and allocation pattern between stem diameter (D) and plant height (H) were investigated using canopy photosynthesis and two-dimensional continuity equation models including D and H as two independent variables. Broad-leaved type plants (more foliage mass in the upper layer than in the lower layer of the canopy of an individual when grown in isolation) showed curvilinear D-H relationship and bimodal H distribution, and underwent more asymmetric competition than coniferous type plants (more foliage mass in the lower layer than in the upper layer of the canopy of an individual when grown in isolation) under crowded conditions. Coniferous type plants showed almost linear D-X relationship (i.e. simple allometry) and unimodal H distribution, and underwent more symmetric competition than broad-leaved type plants under crowded conditions. However, in both the cases D distributions were unimodal. Allocation patterns between D and H affected these features only a little. These simulation results can explain many actual data already published. The value of eta for an individual plant (foliage profile parameter of an individual canopy representing a species-specific branching pattern and canopy morphology when grown in isolation) governs size structure (bimodal or unimodal), the mode of competition, D-H relationship and mean D-mean H trajectory with time under crowded conditions. Therefore, a simple view of the competition-allometry relationship that competition determines allometry should be re-evaluated incorporating the foliage profile of an individual. These theoretical results should also be important when studying species coexistence. The canopy tends to be multi-layered in broad-leaved type plants and mono-layered in coniferous type plants. Therefore, it is hypothesized that species coexistence in the former is mainly by way of separation of vertical space (i.e. niche separation under strongly asymmetric competition) and that species coexistence in the latter is due to nearly symmetric competition in a single canopy layer.
