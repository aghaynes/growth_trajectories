# The problem

Empirical patterns to be explained

- patterns of growth with respect to size
	- hump-shaped pattern of height growth
	- increasing basal area growth
- strong differences among species in growth rate, causes not well understood. Traits implicated but results often weak.
- trait effects on demography
	- size effect moderated by trait
	- absence of relationship between growth rate and lma at larger sizes
		- lma does actually have an effect at smaller sizes
	- strong effect of max height on dbh growth, due to reproductive allocation rather than cross correlation with other traits
- effect of traits on shade tolerance
- ontogenetic shift in traits
- decline in RGR with size

Why models don't work for large plants

- focussed on mass production

In fact, find stronger than previously reported.

The traits approach

- People looking to use traits as indicators of plant performance
- Strong results linking traits to plant function, but attempts to link traits with growth often disappointing
- In part problem is lack of theory through which we can interpret empirical results: need to understand how size, light environment and traits interact to determine growth.
- Here we provide a mechanistic framework describing how traits link to demography
- Contradicts widespread assumption that traits relate to growth in simple linear way
- Think about traits as defining potential trajectory, rather than making species fast or slow growing per se.

The growth approach

- Plant growth is important: forest productivity, biodiversity, carbon.
- Growth driven by environmental drivers, but species within same environment can also differ markedly in growth rate. Such differences might arise from differences in functional traits.
- Currently no definite framework for scaling effects of traits to growth.
- Attempts to quantify relationship empirically show mixed results.


Novelty

- fresh empirical analysis highlights how effect of traits on pot growth changes with size.
	- effect of lma stronger than previously thought, bridges from seedling studies to adults
- mechanistic model of height and dbh growth which accounts for effects of size, light environment and traits
	- need to account for size long recognized, but not straightforward
	- look at growth in wide range of measures: mass, height, dbh
	- can display advantage in dbh growth advantage, even if mass growth
- Compared to previous work, shows effects of traits more about allocation than mass production
- Functional balance model of growth
	- height to leaf area
	-
- Framework for generalising about effect of traits

# Outline

## Introduction


Functional traits capture core differences in the strategies plants use
to generate and invest surplus energy\citep{wright_world_wide_2004, chave_towards_2009,westoby_plant_2002}.

- Traits reflect idea that although plants have same basic function, differ in some strategic ways, in terms of how they invest energy.
- Data for prominent traits now exists for many of the world's 250000 plant species\citep{cornwell_functional_2014}.
- Known that traits drive differences in multiple aspects of plant function, including mechanical strength, biomass partitioning, and rates of photosynthesis and tissue turnover\citep{wright_world_wide_2004,chave_towards_2009, westoby_plant_2002}.
- Idea has taken hold that traits are useful for simplifying biodiversity, as such have been adopted both as a indicator of species' ecologies and as a target of evolution.

While traits may link directly to aspects of plant function, attempts at using traits to explain patterns of whole-plant growth have had mixed success.

- Strong link with lma to growth rate in seedlings, but absence of relationship between growth rate and lma at larger sizes led many to question usefulness of lma
- Other traits, such as wd show only weak relationship in seedlings.
- Seems that link between traits and growth influenced by size, and not simply fixed linear correlations that hold despite context.

The challenge of interpreting diverse empirical results is harder without clear expectations on what signal might look like, given our understanding of trait biology.

- Empirical data suggest need to understand how size, light environment and traits interact to determine growth.
- This is primary role of models: to lay expectations based on present understandings of pant function.
- A widely-used theoretical model suggests mass-based RGR linear function of sla.
- Extension of model to larger sizes suggests relationship hold in larger plants.
- But doesn't match empirical results.

A further problem with existing models, is that effects of traits are all realised via mass production, whereas the effect of some prominent traits is most likely on tissue construction, allocation and turnover.

- mass production works in seedlings, where mass production easily measured
- in large plots, most common to measure diameter.
- But more fundamentally, no reason why effects of prominent traits channel solely via mass production.

Here we provide a mechanistic framework describing how traits link to demography, linking to commonly used metrics such as height and diameter growth, combine this with fresh empirical insight using largest collation of growth and trait data available, from long-term plot at BCI, Panama.

- Shows why effect of traits changes with size,size dependent effect differs among traits.
	- Contradicts widespread assumption that traits relate to growth in simple linear way
- Offers framework for interpreting and understanding empirical results

## Fresh empirical motivation

Introduce new empirical results here

Fresh empirical analysis highlights how effect of traits on pot growth changes with size.

- Effect of lma stronger than previously thought,
- Bridges from seedling studies to adults

Results stronger than previously reported.


## Materials and Methods

### Conceptual framework

Builds on 2011 paper -  highlight what's new from there.

Decomposition of diameter and height growth

Functional-balance Model of growth

- four key assumptions.
- simple linear functions non-critical for results of this paper,
- explore using an example model, but any model with basic size effects will display same behaviour
	- details about our model ()
	- show argument hold intuiatively

Embedding trait-related trade-offs

- use table with arrows to

Connection to earlier work

- generalised version
- present old model as dp/dt so consistent with ours

### Model details

### Empirical growth data


## Results

### Changes in growth rate with size


### How traits influence growth rate

LMA

Wood density

HMax

## Figures and tables

**Figure 1 - The relationship between traits and potential growth rate varies with plant size.**

**Figure 2 - Conceptual framework for understanding size-dependent changes in growth rate.**


- how to explain well changing size effects in context of this figure, perhaps linking to other figures


**Figure 3 - Key assumptions of our functional balance and trait trade-offs model, evaluated using global data.**

a. 3 key assumptions about plant allometry
b. Trait-related trade-offs (LMA, WD, HMAT)

**Figure 4 - The effect of traits on growth changes with size and light environment.**

Traits moderate the responsiveness of growth to changes in light environment

This figure needs to show more of key result with respect to to size.

Possibly separate figure


**Figure 5 - Low construction cost leads to shade intolerance, because of costs of high turnover.**


**Table 1 - Key equations of growth model**

- key parameters of model

**Table 2 - effect of traits on demography**

- combines previous tables 1 & 2


## Discussion

- mechanistic model of height and dbh growth which accounts for effects of size, light environment and traits
	- need to account for size long recognized, but not straightforward
	- look at growth in wide range of measures: mass, height, dbh
- Compared to previous work, shows effects of traits more about allocation than mass production

### Tree growth more than just photosynthesis

Recently realisation that allocation and turnover major areas of uncertainty

Model reconciles idea that traits can have negative impact on carbon budget, but still have positive influence on growth rates

- Enquist 2007: sla and wd increase mass-production, where as in our theory effects on mass production are negative. (also contradicts earlier model from Enquist 1999, where argued wood density had no effect on mass production)

Assumes low lma and wd used to reduce costs of building leaf and stem, ie. total leaf area and stem corss section remains same. In this way differs to assumptions of recent work by anten_role_2010, larjavaara_rethinking_2010.

Model is realisation of several ideas that have been around for some time.

### Towards a global model of tree growth

Key patterns explained

Data challenges

Reproductive allocation

### Detecting trait signals in data

Need more than simply look for correlation with mean growth rate

- understand influences of size on trait of interest
- traits define potential growth rate --> how to extract this
- ideally start to use mechanistic models

### Implications for trait-based approaches

How do comparative people interpret sla now - beyond fast slow.

Think about traits as defining potential trajectory, rather than making species fast or slow growing per se.

Selection on traits in different parts of lifecycle

Trait plasticity - can explain, no clear advantage of low lma at large sizes

Framework for generalising about effect of traits
